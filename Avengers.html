Director Nick Fury. He first approached Tony Stark with the idea, following Tony’s defeat of Obadiah Stane and his subsequent public announcement that he was Iron Man. Fury kept his eye on several potential members, as Bruce Banner struggled with life as the Hulk, the Asgardian Thor appeared on Earth, and Steve Rogers, AKA World War II hero Captain America, was discovered alive decades after his apparent death. In the meantime, some of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s most skilled members, Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff), and Hawkeye (Clint Barton), were making a name for themselves and impressing Fury. Once the Asgardian trickster god Loki arrived on Earth and absconded with the massively powerful object known as the Tesseract—possessing Hawkeye and turning him into his brainwashed pawn in the process—Fury found it necessary to finally bring together his potential super team, calling in Romanoff, Banner, Rogers and Stark. Captain America and Iron Man, assisted by Black Widow, were able to capture Loki, but during their flight back to S.H.I.E.L.D., Thor arrived, attempting to bring his brother back to Asgard to face justice. A fight ensued between Thor and Iron Man, but Captain America broke it up, and the group all returned with their prisoner, Loki, to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier.While Stark and Banner found some common ground through their love of science, the would-be team were at odds as they discussed their next course of action, and arguments escalated in the wake of discovering that S.H.I.E.L.D. had been using the Tesseract to recreate dangerous HYDRA weapons.

            Loki revealed that it was his plan to be captured all along and triggered Banner to turn into the Hulk. While engaging in a fight with Thor, Hulk nearly destroyed the Helicarrier, before crashing down to Earth. Escaping in the chaos, Loki then ejected Thor from the Helicarrier in his own enclosed cell and retrieved his scepter, killing Phil Coulson with it. Black Widow fought Hawkeye, who had arrived to help Loki, managing to bring her friend back to his true self in the process. Loki continued on to New York where, with the help of the brainwashed Dr. Erik Selvig, he opened a portal into space, unleashing a devastating Chitauri army.
            Motivated by the tragic death of Phil Coulson, Iron Man, Black Widow, Captain America, and Hawkeye all headed to New York to fight Loki and his invading Chitauri forces, and were soon joined again by Thor and Hulk, with the six heroes truly assembling as the Avengers for the first time.</p>

Director Nick Fury, the Avengers operate independently upon their formation, working with S.H.I.E.L.D., but not answering to them or any other government agency. In the wake of the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. had been infiltrated by HYDRA, the Avengers arguably become even more independent, as Tony Stark continues to provide them with their equipment, resources, and staff. The team also relocates from Avengers Tower (originally Stark Tower) in Manhattan to a Stark-owned facility in upstate New York.Following devastation wrought by the Super Villain Ultron, the Avengers add more members to its roster, including Sam Wilson AKA Falcon, Wanda Maximoff AKA Scarlet Witch, the android Vision, and James Rhodes AKA War MachineThe Sokovia Accords call for the Avengers to begin answering to the United Nations, who would have a say in what missions they undertake and which parts of the world they could operate in. Under Iron Man’s leadership, some of the Avengers briefly operate under these guidelines, as they seek to halt the dissenting Captain America’s rogue actions, along with the Avengers who fight with him. With Iron Man and Captain America’s conflict escalating and left unresolved, the Avengers effectively break up—though Stark, War Machine (James Rhodes) and Vision still operate out of Avengers headquarters, there is no longer an ongoing team. The reunion of many Avengers during Thanos’ attack on Earth, including Steve Rogers, finds the team operating on their own again and against the wishes of the government, as Rhodes disobeys direct orders from Thaddeus Ross to arrest fugitives Rogers, Wanda Maximoff, Natasha Romanoff, and Sam Wilson..</p>
